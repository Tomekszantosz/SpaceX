The main goal was to make an interactive dashboard about the SpaceX launches. First, data was collected from wikipedia using BeautifulSoup python l√≠brary for web sracping. Then followed the data engineering part, where i handled the data, filled missing values and added descriptive new data to be visualized. Data visualisation made with Plotly and lastly Dash to make in interactive. With the completed project the success rate of the SpaceX launches can be seen. Moreover launches can be filtered by the rocket payload range and the rocket booster version. With these information one can see the correlation between these datas and make assumption about a future rocket success.
